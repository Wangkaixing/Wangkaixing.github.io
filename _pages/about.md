I am a second year master student in the School of Computer Science and Technology, [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/). Currently, I am studying in the [State Key Laboratory of Cryptology](https://sca.gov.cn/sca/ztpd/qgzdsys.shtml), Beijing, China, and luckly being advised by researcher [Jiang Zhang](https://dblp.org/pid/94/2739-1.html).

My main research interests lie in the general areas of security and cryptography, including homomorphic encryption, privacy-preserving machine learning.
