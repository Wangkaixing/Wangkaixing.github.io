I am a second year master student in the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). Currently, I am studying in the State Key Laboratory of Cryptology, Beijing, China, and luckly being advised researcher Jiang Zhang.

My main research interests lie in the general areas of machine learning and cryptography, including homomorphic encryption, privacy-preserving machine learning, and so on.
